My personal solutions for the Advent of Code 2020

**Note**: The purpose of this library is simply to preserve some old code I wrote back in 2020. It does not represent any best practices and may not be of much use to many people. If I were to do it again, I would most likely structure my solutions in a much more sophisticated way. That being said, please feel free to look through some of these old solutions and try to learn from them. I hope this can be of help to some people.
